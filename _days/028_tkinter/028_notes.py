#Dynamic typing



#Python is strongly typed in that the type of a variable is monitored
#Type errors will be given where appropriate

#Below creates a type error
# print(3 + "4")

#Dynamic means Python knows what type a variable is and what a function expects
#You can dynamically change the type of a variable like below

# a = 3
# print(type(a))
# a = "3"
# print(type(a))
